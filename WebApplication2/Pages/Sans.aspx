    <h1 style="color: white; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS'">Sans</h1>
    <p style="color: white; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS'">Sans is non dout one of the most iconic video game characters of all time. Sans is a comidian making jokes on his brother and witch his brother. But can get series when needed and oh boy he getting series in the genocide route. Sans is one of the 3 characters that knows this is all just a game with save points and resets. Sans is the one who judges you at the end of Neutral Route, he also the one who calls you after the fight with flowey. by now even if you know only a little bit about undertale you know that you fight him, and this battle is the reason undertale is so famous. the fight is hard very hard because Sans knows you can just load the save file over and over again, thats what you are doing anyway, so Sans fight your determination trying to make you give up and reset it all. but if you are determend enough you will beat him, thats why when you fight him he just dodge the attack and makes you try attacking him 24 times. also if you dies Sans will count your death total up to 11 and a part of other monsters even if you close and reopen the game he remember and keep counting.</p>
    <p style="color: white; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS'">if you close and reopen the game at the judgement couple of times sans will notic it and makes you say stupid words to prove you are a time traveler to the other Sans, anywway after a lot of time he will give you the key to his room, which is just a big prank like always with sans.</p>
    <p style="color: white; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS'">Behing a boss fight and even the final boss of the Genocide Route, Sans can change your soul color and likes his brother he changes it to blue means you have gravity, but instead it behing only down Sans have the power to change your gravity to any directions and use it to attack your hard.</p>
