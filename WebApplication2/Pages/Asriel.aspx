    <h1 style="color: white;">Asriel Dreemurr</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">Asriel is the child of Torial and Asgore, thats why his name his their combined. But its not just it, Asriel Dremurr is an anagram for serial murderer thats because he killed everyone multiple times when he was Flowey.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">Asriel is the final boss of True Pacifist Route and my favorite boss in the entire gaming history. The music is amazing my favorite too. The feelings in this fight is just insane. The battle start when you learn Flowey have tricked you to make all of your friends come to the same place at the same time so he will killed all of them and then evey monster cheers you up but then Flowey just killed them all and takes there souls. With every monster soul in the underground and the 6 human souls Flowey gains the power of 7 human souls makes him a THE ABSOLUTE GOD OF HYPER DEATH form which is Asriel. After a very emotional battle Asriel regain the ability to feel feelings and sorry for everything he did as a Flowey and breaks the barrier before giving the monster souls away.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">Asriel fight you because he thinks you are Chara his dead sibling, the only one who understood him. He was the first to see Chara after they have fall from above and had adopted Chara as his sibling.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">After Chara and Asriel made a plan to combind their soul and cross the barrier and killing 6 human from the surface. But the plan goes wrong when Asriel came holding Chara's body, the human though he killed them so they kill him. Chara controling half of Asriel tries to attack back and killing everyone but Asriel did not want to and because he was controling half of his body too, they died going back to the underground. thats why Flowey takes the sentence of "KILL OR BE KILLDED!".</p>
