    <h1 style="color: white;">Flowey</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">Flowey is one of the Most annoying cretaures in gaming and as a all, never in my life I wanted to kill something so badly. Flowey is the first character you see in the game, and he is a small little flowey so why wont you trust him, WRONG !!! He strike you on the first change he gets on you and expains that from his point of view its all "KILLED OR BE KILLED". thankefully Torial is saving you at the last moment. Flowey is discovered to be non other than Asriel Dreemurr, after dying and scattering dust on the garden of Asgore Alphys inject him with a DETERMINATION giving him the ability to exist, not living because he still does not have a saul so he can not feel any emotion but he remembers everything and can walk around as a flower, but the determination have given him also the abilities to reset and load save file. At first waking up, Flowey help everyone and love everyone but after getting bored he killed some, and then more, and then more.... until the everyone died but he still got bored so he reset everyone and killed them all again, eventually Sans notice him and fight him for killing everyone but Flowey unlike Sans can just reset it when Sans killes him. Eventually finally Flowey did not know what he can do next so he yells to Chara to come back because they where the only one who understands him.</p>
